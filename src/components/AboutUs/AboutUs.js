      <p>We are a locally-owned business started by a group of passionate dog lovers and owners who call Annapolis and the surrounding area home. Our mission is to provide a safe and fun environment where you and your furry friends can enjoy quality time together.</p>
      <p>As former & current dog owners ourselves, we understand how important it is to have a reliable and trustworthy place to bring your pets. That's why we've made it our mission to create a welcoming and inclusive community where everyone feels like family. Whether you're a regular visitor or a first-time guest, we promise to provide a memorable experience for you and your furry friend.</p>
      <p>At DJ's Dog Park Bar, we're proud to offer amenities like off-leash play areas, dog-friendly seating, and a wide selection of drinks and snacks. We believe that every dog deserves a place where they can run, play, and socialize with other pups. Our team is dedicated to creating an atmosphere that celebrates the bond between dogs and their humans.</p>
      <p>Our bar is named after the brother-sister pair of owners born in Annapolis. We are passionate about creating a space that caters to both dogs and their owners, and we are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for all.
